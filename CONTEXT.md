# Prism — Project Context

## Overview

**Prism** is a modern, local-only Android gallery app built as a full replacement for Google Photos on a Sony Xperia 1V (Android 15). It is inspired by the Sony Ericsson Gallery app (`com.sonyericsson.gallery` v3.2.A.0.21) but rebuilt entirely from scratch using modern Android architecture.

The core philosophy: **your photos live on your device. Prism never touches the cloud.**

> **Status (11 May 2026):** All planned phases complete. App is building and running on device. Currently in beta testing. Three root-cause bugs fixed this session (gallery filter, viewer context, crop save to SD card). Build errors resolved. Next milestone: signed release APK.

## Target Device

**Sony Xperia 1V** running **Android 15 (API 35)**. All permissions, media APIs, and features must be validated against Android 13+ media permission model (`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`) and Android 15 behaviour changes.

---

## Why We're Building This

Google Photos on Android 15 has two critical pain points this user experiences daily:
1. **Constant cloud backup pressure** — repeated prompts and UI nudges to back up to Google cloud
2. **Delayed photo display** — newly captured photos from the Camera app are not immediately visible in Google Photos when both apps are open

Prism solves both:
- Zero cloud, zero accounts, zero backup prompts — ever
- Instant photo detection via `ContentObserver` registered on `MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI` and `MediaStore.Video.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI` — grid updates within seconds of the Camera app saving a file

---

## Reference APK: Sony Ericsson Gallery v3.2.A.0.21

Decompiled from `com.sonyericsson.gallery_3.2.A.0.21` (minAPI 10, Android 2.3.3 era).

### Features We Are Keeping / Reimplementing

| Feature | Sony Implementation | Prism Implementation |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Photo grid | 3D OpenGL `RenderView` + `GridLayer` | `LazyVerticalGrid` (Compose) with Coil image loading |
| Video playback | `MovieView` + `VideoView` with RTSP/HTTP streaming | Media3 ExoPlayer (local files only) |
| Resume video playback | Dialog prompt to resume from last position | DataStore persisted position per video URI |
| Image crop | `CropImageView` with face detection overlay | UCrop library |
| Rotate left/right | In-place EXIF rotation | EXIF rotation + rewrite |
| Set as wallpaper | `Photographs` activity | `WallpaperManager` intent |
| Set as contact photo | Intent to contacts app | Intent to contacts app |
| Share | Standard share intent | Standard share intent |
| Show on map | Location → maps intent | EXIF GPS → maps intent |
| Slideshow | Auto-advancing viewer | `HorizontalPager` with configurable interval |
| Reverse geocoder | `ReverseGeocoder.java` | `Geocoder` API (offline fallback: raw GPS coordinates) |
| Dominant color extraction | `ExtractColorTask.java` | Palette API (Compose `MaterialTheme` dynamic theming) |
| Camera folder | First-class album | First-class album (sorted by `DATE_TAKEN` desc) |
| Storage location labels | eMMC / SD card labels | Internal / SD card badges |
| Face detection (crop) | In `CropImage` activity | UCrop handles aspect ratio; face detection stretch goal (ML Kit) |

### Features We Are Dropping

| Sony Feature | Reason Dropped |
|-------------|----------------|
| Facebook integration (sync, likes, comments) | No cloud / no social |
| Renren integration (Chinese social network) | No cloud / no social |
| Picasa/Google sync | No cloud |
| DLNA "Play on Device" casting | Out of scope for v1 |
| NFC Handover Service | Out of scope for v1 |
| IDD (In-Device Debug) probes | Sony private API, irrelevant |
| Illumination API | Sony private API, irrelevant |
| Account management | No accounts in Prism |
| Edit Video (Sony video editor) | Out of scope for v1 |
| Display Settings (in video) | Out of scope for v1 |
| RTSP/HTTP streaming | Local files only |
| DRM content restrictions | No DRM handling needed |
| Home screen widget | Stretch goal |

### Key Observations from APK Analysis

- The Sony gallery used a **3D OpenGL grid renderer** (`RenderView`, `GridLayer`, `GridCamera`, `GridInputProcessor`) — visually impressive for 2011 but overkill. Prism uses Compose's `LazyVerticalGrid` with smooth animations instead.
- `GalleryApplication` generated a **unique device ID from IMEI hash** for telemetry — Prism has zero telemetry.
- `BootReceiver` listened to `MEDIA_MOUNTED` / `MEDIA_UNMOUNTED` events to refresh caches — Prism uses `ContentObserver` which is more granular and doesn't require a device reboot.
- `BitmapManager` and `DiskCache` handled manual thumbnail caching — Coil handles this automatically with memory + disk caching.
- `MonitoredActivity` was a base class for lifecycle monitoring — replaced by standard Compose lifecycle-aware ViewModels.
- Slideshow and selection modes were part of the main `Gallery` activity — Prism separates these into dedicated composables.
- `ExtractColorTask` extracted dominant colors — we use Android's `Palette` API for the same purpose with dynamic Material 3 theming.

## Known Bug Fixes Applied

| Bug | Fix | Commit |
|-----|-----|--------|
| Bottom nav bar flashing when closing viewer | `AnimatedVisibility` + 220ms delay on show | `cb1a1a9` |
| Horizontal pager swipe broken when zoomed | Custom `awaitEachGesture` — only consumes touch when scale > 1 | `cb1a1a9` |
| Video on adjacent pages blocked swipe | Adjacent pages show static `AsyncImage` thumbnail, not live player | `cb1a1a9` |
| UCrop `currentItem` unresolved in launcher callback | `editingDisplayName` state var captured at tap time | `920bf41` |
| Cropped photo not appearing in gallery | `DATE_TAKEN`, `DATE_ADDED`, `DATE_MODIFIED` now written to MediaStore on save | `bbcba1a` |
| `bucketId` type mismatch (Long vs String) | `Album.id` and `MediaItem.bucketId` are `String` | `9251de5` |
| Gallery not refreshing after crop save | `MutableSharedFlow` manual refresh trigger in `MediaStoreRepository`; `refreshMedia()` called after save | `adb5b8c` |
| Search bar + UCrop toolbar behind status bar on Android 15 | `statusBarsPadding()` on SearchScreen column; `windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement` on UCropActivity theme | `15b4451` |
| Swipe-to-dismiss 1-second delay | `onNavigateBack()` called immediately at threshold (not after animation); fly-off reduced 220ms → 120ms; bottom bar delay 220ms → 80ms | `482c103` |
| Crop save not indexed by MediaStore | `MediaScannerConnection.scanFile()` called after `IS_PENDING=0` update | `482c103` |
| isCameraRoll() filter broken on Sony OEM folder names | Replaced with `isInDcim(relativePath)` — checks `RELATIVE_PATH.startsWith("DCIM/")`; `MediaItem` + `Album` now carry `relativePath` field queried from MediaStore | `b42a8d2` |
| Viewer swipe showed photos outside gallery context | `ViewerViewModel` now reads `filter` arg from `SavedStateHandle`; gallery passes `"gallery"`, album detail passes `"bucket:{id}"`, search passes `"all"` | `b42a8d2` |
| Settings album picker was overflowing horizontal scroll | Replaced `LazyRow` + `FilterChip` with `OutlinedButton` → `AlertDialog` + `LazyColumn` + `Checkbox` | `b42a8d2` |
| Crop saved to internal storage even when original is on SD card | `EditHelper.volumeCollectionUri()` reads volume name from URI path segments and inserts into the same volume | `3569910` |
| Double-tap zoom was instant (no animation) | `scale`/`panX`/`panY` converted to `Animatable`; zoom-in uses `spring(NoBouncy)`, zoom-out uses parallel `tween(280ms)` | `3569910` |
| Build error: stale duplicate lines in `MediaStoreRepository.kt` | Removed leftover `bucketName`/`duration` lines from previous edit | `69d9936` |
| Build error: Unicode arrow in KDoc caused `DCIM/*` to be parsed as block comment open | Replaced `→` with ASCII `->` in `ViewerViewModel` comment | `69d9936` |

---

## Known Open Issues (Side Notes)

| Issue | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Cropped copy sorted to wrong position in Prism gallery | `EditHelper.saveToMediaStore` sets `DATE_TAKEN = now` (edit time) instead of the original photo's `dateTaken`. Fix: pass `originalDateTaken: Long` as a parameter and write it to `MediaStore.Images.Media.DATE_TAKEN`. |

## Step-by-Step Development Rule

> **IMPORTANT — always follow this workflow:**
> 1. State clearly what change will be made and why, before touching any file.
> 2. Make the change.
> 3. Run `get_errors` on every modified file.
> 4. If there are errors, fix them before proceeding to the next step.
> 5. Ask the user a question if the correct approach is unclear — never guess at the intention.
> 6. Update `CONTEXT.md` and `README.md` at the end of every session.

## Reference APK: Sony Ericsson Gallery v3.2.A.0.21

Decompiled from `com.sonyericsson.gallery_3.2.A.0.21` (minAPI 10, Android 2.3.3 era).

### Key Observations

- The Sony gallery used a **3D OpenGL grid renderer** (`RenderView`, `GridLayer`, `GridCamera`) — visually impressive for 2011 but replaced by Compose `LazyVerticalGrid` with Coil.
- `GalleryApplication` generated a **unique device ID from IMEI hash** for telemetry — Prism has zero telemetry.
- `BootReceiver` listened to `MEDIA_MOUNTED` / `MEDIA_UNMOUNTED` — Prism uses `ContentObserver` which is more granular.
- `BitmapManager` and `DiskCache` handled manual thumbnail caching — Coil handles this automatically.
- Facebook/Renren/Picasa integrations dropped — no cloud, no social.
- DLNA casting, NFC Handover, Sony Illumination API, IDD probes — all dropped (Sony private APIs or out of scope).

## Development Notes

- All commits follow conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`
- JVM heap set to 2048MB in `gradle.properties`
- `gradlew` not committed — use Android Studio Build menu or `./gradlew` from the project root after first sync
- ProGuard/R8 enabled (`isMinifyEnabled = true`) for release builds
